# Merge .Xresources
# On ArchLinux, GDM sources the user .Xresources with `-nocpp` so none of the
# includes are processed. Do a real load here (and leave /etc/gdm/Xsession

# This also lets me keep .Xresources out of ~/
has_program "xrdb" && \
  xrdb -merge -I"$DOTFILES" "${DOTFILES}/xresources/.Xresources"
