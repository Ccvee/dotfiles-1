# Shell files

These mostly get sourced by the shell environment (bash/zsh/display manager),
except:

- `.inputrc` is symlinked
- `base16-twilight.dark.sh` should be sourced manually when using a terminal
  that does not have the base16 color scheme installed (e.g. when using someone
  else's terminal emulator or one that does not have theme support).
