# vim config

Keep `(g)vimrc` (no dot in filename) in `.vim` -- vim knows to look in there.

## Plugins I intentionally don't use
- ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim
    - I always just `ag` from a terminal or open an exact filename in vim
- jeetsukumaran/vim-buffergator
    - Using vim-airline to show buffers all the time, unimpaired switches
    - alternatively, CtrlP has a buffer mode if I wanted it
- kien/tabman.vim
    - vim-airline could show tabs, custom mappings to switch
    - alternatively, CtrlP does the same thing if I wanted it
- nathanaelkane/vim-command-w
    - doesn't work, macvim specific
- scrooloose/nerdtree
- shougo/neosnippet.vim
    - UltiSnips has WordPress.vim integration
- shougo/unite.vim
    - CtrlP has auto WordPress.vim integration
- techlivezheng/vim-plugin-minibufexpl
    - vim-airline does this
    - don't like the double status line
- vim-scripts/kwbdi.vim
    - Bufkill is newer
