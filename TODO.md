TODO
====

* Move zsh files into zsh folder
* Move bash files into bash folder
* Move vim dotfiles into vim folder
* Add bash installation option (sometimes you can't install zsh :[ )
* Add instructions for OS-based provisioning using chef from bootstrap.zsh, which will provide dependencies (except ruby which is a dependency of chef)
* Rewrite bootstrap.zsh and dotfiles into to cookbooks (removes dependency on zsh to install)
* Create branches for archlinux and ubuntu testing, move Vagrantfiles there
